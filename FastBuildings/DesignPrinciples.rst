Design of FastBuildings library

Introduction
############

This document describes the design choices for the Modelica library **FastBuildings**.  

Goal of the library
=========================

**FastBuildings** is a library for building energy simulation with the following ambitions:

- low order models for fast simulation, upscaling to districts and optimization
- single and multiple zone building simulation
- modular and easily extensible
- can be compiled by JModelica (also to FMUX) and OpenModelica
- compatible with the **IDEAS** library


Basic principles and use
=========================

The most natural interaction with the models is through a **Building** model.
A **Building** (*bui*) is composed of one or more thermal zones (*zon*), an HVAC model (*hva*), user behaviour (*use*) and a Simulation Input Manager (*sim*). 


Structure
=========================

The library has the following typological subpackages:

- Zones
  - Windows
- Buildings
- HVAC
- Users
- Input
- Examples

Conventions
###############

Imports
========
The following imports are put on the top level, so usable anywhere in the package: ::

    import SI = Modelica.SIunits;
    import HT = Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer;

Naming
=======

Class names can be long and descriptive.  They should always start with a capital. For instance names, different rules apply.

.. Important::

    **All instance names start with a small letter.** 
    
    **Camel case is applied to all instance names.**
    
    **Wherever possible, 3 letter abbreviations are used.**
    
    One of the only exceptions to these conventions are *T* and *Q_flow* order to maintain compatibility with the *Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer* package and avoid confusion.

Many models will be built according to an resistance-capacitor (RC) analogy. It's important to be consistent in the naming of all these components.  Therefore, it is adopted to name the components as follows:

- resistance: **resXyz[Int/Ext][1-9]** (eg. resZon, resWalInt, resWalExt, resFlo1)
- capacitor: **capXyz[1-9]** (eg. capZon, capHea)
- thermal resistance (parameter): **rXyz[Int/Ext][1-9]**, where Xyz[io][1-9] corresponds to the resistor component (eg. rZon, rWalInt, ...)
- thermal capacity (parameter): **cXyz[1-9]**, where Xyz[1-9] corresponds to the resistor component (eg. cZon, cHea, ...)

Others:

- windows: **win[1-9]** (eg. win1, win2)
- All temperatures start with **T** (TAmb, TWalInt ...) 
- **rHum, vWin** stand for ambient temperature, relative humidity and wind speed 
- **iGloHor**, **irr[1-9]**: global horizontal radiation, irradiation on a specific surface (eg. irr1, irr2)
- design conditions: add *Des* (TAmbDes)
- nominal values: add *Nom* (Q_flowNom)
- all heatPorts are named **heaPor[...]**
- sensors, prescribed temperatures and prescribed heat flows: **senXyz, preXyz**, where Xyz is the variable that is measured (eg. senTZon, preTAmb, preQHeaEmb) 

Aliases and propagation
=========================

All parameters of *resistances, capacitors* etc. have to be progagated to the level of the *zone*.  This allows to switch more easily between different zone models in a building.  The naming has to be consistent (see above). 

For example, avoid this: :: 
    
    model NotNice
      Capacitor capZon(c = 1e6) "Thermal capacity of the zone";
    end NotNice;

but prefer this: ::
    
    model Nice
      parameter SI.HeatCapacity cZon = 1e6 "Thermal capacity of the zone";
      Capacitor capZon(C = cZon);
    end Nice;
    
This may seem inefficient, but it allows for instance to specify a thermal resistance for an exterior wall at zone level, and split this resistance according to a specific rule over the different *resistance* components in the wall itself.  Example: ::

    model Example_SplittedResistance_Fix 
      extends FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Partials.Partial_SZ;
      
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Capacitor capZon(C = cZon) ;
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Capacitor capWal(C = cWal) ;
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Resistance resWale(R = 0.5 * rWal) ;
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Resistance resWali(R = 0.5 * rWal) ;
      
      parameter SI.HeatCapacity cZon "Thermal capacity of the zone" ;
      parameter SI.HeatCapacity cWal "Thermal capacity of the zone" ;
      parameter SI.ThermalResistance rWal "Total thermal resistance of the walls, in K/W" ;
            
    equation
      ...
    
    end Example_SplittedResistance_Fix;  
    
    
    model Example_SplittedResistance_Free 
      extends FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Partials.Partial_SZ_CRE;
      
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Capacitor capZon(C = cZon) ;
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Capacitor capWal(C = cWal) ;
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Resistance resWale(R = (1-posCapWal) * rWal) ;
      FastBuildings.Zones.BaseClasses.Resistance resWali(R = posCapWal * rWal) ;
      
      parameter SI.HeatCapacity cZon "Thermal capacity of the zone" ;
      parameter SI.HeatCapacity cWal "Thermal capacity of the zone" ;
      parameter SI.ThermalResistance rWal "Total thermal resistance of the walls, in K/W" ;
      parameter Real posCapWal = 0.5 (min=0, max=1) "Position of the capacity in the wall: 0=inside, 1=outside";
      
    equation
      ...
    
    end Example_SplittedResistance_Free;  

Issues, questions, doubts
=========================

Concept: having all inputs through the sim seems nice and clean (sim = Simulation Input or Info Manager).  However, there are some limitations, both from the language and from the tools.  An overview of issues that shaped the design:

* not possible to redeclare outer components (Modelica specs?)
* this is not problematic: if the inner is a subtype of the outer it works. So we have to choose the right inner component at the top level of every simulation, and it has to extend from a PartialSim.  Every model should have the following declaration:  ``outer PartialSim sim``.
* In order to make graphical connections from the sim to other components, eg in a zone model, this PartialSim should have the necessary connectors (RealOutputs). This means that all possible inputs have to be defined in the Partial.
* previous tests showed however that unused components (like dummy HeatPorts) are not removed from the optimization problem.  Therefore, they increase the problem complexity and this should be avoided
* to keep the models lean, I tried to declare those connectors as conditional realoutputs.  The extended sim models can specify which connectors are available by specifying the booleans.  
* the difficulty is that conditional components can only be referenced in connect equations.  So specifying a value for a conditional RealOutput cannot be done in an equation.  A RealExpression or similar has to be used, and it's output connected to the conditional RealOutput.  This seems inefficient and error-prone.
* moreover, it seems that JModelica has issues with the booleans. The models compile fine, but the CasadiModel cannot be instantiated.  The following error message is thrown: ::

    RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-84-790aa345e46f> in <module>()

      32405     def addVariable(self, *args):

    RuntimeError: SymbolicOCP::readExpr: Unknown node: BooleanLiteral
 
* It looks like the only solution is to have a rather generic and complete PartialSim **with unconditional outputs**, and specify the values of each of the outputs in the extended sim models.   

Naming: booXXX for booleans? 

How to specify the Q_flow of heaPorEmb?  

conventions: powEle, qHeaCoo ?
